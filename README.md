Full disclosure: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1133851639 was used as a base.
I tried using it myself at first but noticed several problems including the deprecated RPC library.
The main problem was that the add-on/repository had not been updated to fix these issues for more than half a year.
So I decided to (hopefully) fix all the issues and improve the add-on overall as well as keep updating it if anything pops up

If anyone has any problems with this being up or just general feedback - `tadz#1030` on Discord.
